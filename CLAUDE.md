```

This process ensures: âœ… Code quality âœ… No regressions âœ… Current documentation âœ… Clear change history âœ… Consistent standards

## Architecture

### State Management

The application uses a hybrid approach with React Context API for global state and custom hooks for data management:

**Active Contexts:**

- `TokenContext` - Manages API tokens stored in localStorage and account switching
- `CharacterContext` - Handles character data and crafting
- `SkillContext` - Manages skill data
- `StaticDataContext` - Manages static GW2 API data (items, material categories, colors, skins, titles, currencies, outfits, home nodes, and home cats) with global caching, localStorage persistence, version-aware cache management, and optimized fetching strategies (complete datasets for colors/titles/currencies/material categories/home data, chunked fetching for items/skins/outfits)

**Custom Hooks (replacing previous contexts):**

- `useItemsData` - Manages all item-related data including account items (inventory, bank, materials) and character items with batched fetching (replaced ItemContext and merged useAccountItemsData)
- `useTitles` - Fetches account titles with title details managed by StaticDataContext for efficient caching
- `useWallet` - Fetches account wallet with currency details managed by StaticDataContext for efficient caching
- `useSkins` - Fetches account skins with skin details managed by StaticDataContext for efficient caching
- `useOutfits` - Fetches account outfits with outfit details managed by StaticDataContext for efficient caching
- `useDyes` - Fetches account dyes with color details managed by StaticDataContext for efficient caching
- `useHomeNodes` - Fetches account home instance nodes with home node data managed by StaticDataContext for efficient caching
- `useHomeCats` - Fetches account home instance cats with home cat data managed by StaticDataContext for efficient caching

**Architecture Principles:**

- Prefer custom hooks over React Context when data is used in limited components
- Reactive patterns where hooks automatically respond to dependency changes
- Public vs Internal API design for proper encapsulation
- Automatic data reset when accounts change
- No direct cross-context manipulation
- See `/src/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed guidelines

### Key API Integration

- Base API: `https://api.guildwars2.com/v2`
- Requires API token for authenticated endpoints
- Language parameter: `lang=en`
- Note: Some items return 404 which is expected behavior

### Routing Structure

- Uses HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Main routes:
  - `/` â†’ redirects to `/characters`
  - `/characters/:profession?` - Character overview and management with optional profession filtering
  - `/items/:category?` - Item inventory with optional category filtering
  - `/skins/:skinType?` - Skins management with pathname-based type filtering (armor, weapon, back, gathering), search, filtering, and sorting
  - `/dyes/:hue?` - Dyes management with hue filtering, search functionality, sortable table and color swatches
  - `/settings` - Token configuration
  - `/account/*` - Account-related pages:
    - `/account/overview` - Account overview with titles
    - `/account/wallet` - Wallet currencies display
    - `/account/outfits` - Outfits display with alphabetical sorting
    - `/account/home` - Home instance nodes and cats with unlocked/locked status

### Code Organization

- `/src/contexts/` - React Context providers for global state (Token, Character, Skill, StaticData)
- `/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions organized by domain
  - `items.ts` - All item-related types (Items, Materials, UserItemInList, etc.)
  - `titles.ts` - Title-related types (AccountTitles, Title from @gw2api/types)
  - `wallet.ts` - Wallet and currency types (AccountWallet, Currency from @gw2api/types)
  - `skins.ts` - Skin-related types (AccountSkins, Skin from @gw2api/types)
  - `outfits.ts` - Outfit-related types (AccountOutfits, Outfit from @gw2api/types)
  - `dyes.ts` - Dye-related types (AccountDyesData, Color, DyeEntryWithDetails from @gw2api/types)
  - `homeNodes.ts` - Home node-related types (AccountHomeNodes from @gw2api/types)
  - `homeCats.ts` - Home cat-related types (HomeCat interface with id and hint)
- `/src/pages/` - Route components
  - `/src/pages/skins/` - Skins page components (elevated to top-level route)
  - `/src/pages/dyes/` - Dyes page components (elevated to top-level route)
- `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components (Pagination, SortableTable)
- `/src/layouts/` - Layout components (BaseFrame, Header)
- `/src/helpers/` - Utility functions for API calls, CSS, URL handling, error handling, type guards, and character data processing
  - `characterItems.ts` - Pure functions for processing character data into item lists
- `/src/pages/items/helpers/` - Item-specific helper functions including rarity comparison and sorting utilities
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for state management and data fetching
- `/src/constants/` - Application constants (API, UI, theme configurations)
- `/src/styles/` - Shared CSS modules for consistent styling across components
- `/src/docs/` - Architecture documentation and guidelines
- `/src/test/` - Test configuration and setup files

**Hook Patterns:**

- Public hooks (`useItemsData`, `useToken`, `useCharacters`, `useSkins`, `useDyes`, `useHomeNodes`, `useHomeCats`) expose read-only data
- Context-based static data management (`StaticDataContext`) with integrated fetching hooks (`useAutoFetchItems`, `useBatchAutoFetchItems`)
- Internal state management with no exposed setter functions for better encapsulation
- Pure helper functions for data transformation preferred over custom hooks when no state is needed
- Direct hook usage preferred over context when data is component-specific
- Generic components support different data types (e.g., Pagination component)

### Important Patterns

- Path alias `~` configured to represent `src/` directory for cleaner imports
- Absolute imports configured from `src/` directory
- Chakra UI for component styling
- React Query for data fetching with comprehensive error handling
- Lodash for utility operations
- date-fns for date formatting
- Generic API functions with TypeScript type parameters
- Type guards for runtime validation (`src/helpers/typeGuards.ts`)
- Performance optimization with React.useMemo for expensive computations
- Discriminated unions for reducer actions
- Reactive architecture with automatic data synchronization
- Separation of concerns with public/internal API patterns
- Constants-based configuration to eliminate magic numbers
- Advanced search functionality supporting JSON.stringify-based queries across all object properties
- Rarity-based visual styling using CSS modules with Guild Wars 2 color theming
- Consistent rarity sorting using shared `compareRarity` function that follows Guild Wars 2 hierarchy (Junk â†’ Basic â†’ Fine â†’ Masterwork â†’ Rare â†’ Exotic â†’ Ascended â†’ Legendary)
- Centralized pagination configuration via ITEM_COUNT_PER_PAGE constant
- Shared helper functions for common operations (e.g., `formatAccessText` for text formatting, `compare` utilities for sorting)
- Color swatch components with RGB to hex conversion for visual color representation
- Sortable table implementation with multi-column support and visual sorting indicators
- Consistent count badges on navigation tabs using Chakra UI Tag component with standardized styling (`size="sm"` and `margin="0 0 -0.1em 0.5em"`)
- Standardized empty/loading/missing token states across all pages for consistent user experience
- Pathname-based routing for filtering (e.g., `/characters/elementalist`, `/skins/armor`, `/dyes/red`) using `useParams` hook instead of query parameters or local state for better URL shareability and navigation
- URL-based state management for sorting and search parameters using React Router v7's built-in `useSearchParams` hook, allowing persistent state across page refreshes and better user experience through shareable URLs (implemented in Items, Skins, Characters, Wallet, and Dyes pages)
- Smart URL parameter isolation: category navigation removes conflicting `type` filters to prevent incorrect state persistence across different item categories
- Hue-based filtering with count badges for Dyes page, following similar patterns established in Skins page for consistent user experience

### Testing

- **Framework:** Vitest with jsdom environment for React component testing
- **Testing Libraries:** @testing-library/react for component testing, @testing-library/jest-dom for DOM matchers
- **Configuration:** `vite.config.ts` includes test configuration with globals enabled
- **Test Files:** Place test files with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extensions anywhere in `src/`
- **Coverage:** Available via `npm run test:coverage`
- **UI:** Interactive test runner available via `npm run test:ui`
- **Test Patterns:** Comprehensive component testing with proper mocking of hooks, React Router v7, and external dependencies. Tests cover UI rendering, data filtering, search functionality, sorting, navigation, URL state management including query string preservation across route changes, hue-based filtering, count badges, and combined filtering scenarios. All tests use React Router's built-in `useSearchParams` mock patterns.

### Code Style

- Prettier configured:
  - Tab width: 2
  - No semicolons
  - Double quotes for strings
  - Trailing commas in multiline
- TypeScript strict mode enabled with comprehensive type safety:
  - Explicit return type annotations on all exported functions
  - Generic type parameters for API functions
  - Type guards for runtime validation
  - Discriminated unions for reducer actions
- Target ES5 with modern library features

### Quality Control Pipeline

- **Husky git hooks** for automated quality checks:
  - Pre-commit: runs lint-staged for staged files
  - Pre-push: comprehensive checks (typecheck, lint, test, build)
- **lint-staged** configuration:
  - TypeScript files: ESLint auto-fix + Prettier formatting
  - Other files: Prettier formatting only
- **Automated validation** ensures code quality before commits and pushes

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling with custom error classes (`src/helpers/errors.ts`)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (`src/helpers/retry.ts`)
- User feedback via toast notifications (`src/hooks/useApiError.ts`)
- Graceful degradation for missing API data (404s return null)

### Performance Considerations

- React.useMemo used for expensive filtering and sorting operations
- Static data caching with global StaticDataContext to minimize redundant API calls
- Batched item fetching with `useBatchAutoFetchItems` for optimal API usage - single request for all item sources
- Chunked API requests for bulk data fetching with automatic retry on failure
- Proper dependency arrays for memoization
- Cache-aware fetching that skips requests for already-cached items

## Recent Major Refactoring (2025-01)

Significant architectural improvements were made to the static data management system:

**Key Changes:**

- **StaticDataContext**: Replaced `useItemCache` hook with a proper React Context for global static data management (now includes items, material categories, colors, skins, titles, currencies, and outfits) with integrated localStorage caching
- **Batched Fetching**: Implemented `useBatchAutoFetchItems` for efficient API usage - single request handles all item sources (character, inventory, bank, materials)
- **Pure Helper Functions**: Extracted `processCharacterItems` to `/src/helpers/characterItems.ts` for better separation of concerns
- **Hook Consolidation**: Merged `useAccountItemsData` into `useItemsData` for unified item management (2025-01-21)
- **Code Consolidation**: Merged and removed redundant hooks (`useItemFetching`, `useBatchItemFetching`, `useMaterialCategoriesData`) into the context, moved color management from `useDyes`, skin management from `useSkins`, title management from `useTitles`, currency management from `useWallet`, and outfit management from `useOutfits` to StaticDataContext with individual useCallback functions to comply with React Hook rules
- **LocalStorage Caching**: Implemented persistent caching of all static data (items, material categories, colors, skins, titles, currencies, outfits) with cache versioning system to prevent stale data across app updates
- **React Router v7 Migration**: Replaced custom `useSearchParams` hook with React Router v7's built-in implementation, eliminating 159 lines of custom URL parameter handling code (2025-01-22)
- **URL Parameter Handling**: Improved search input with direct URLSearchParams usage and useCallback optimization for better performance
- **Type Safety**: Updated from `Item` to `PatchedItem` type throughout the codebase to support extended item properties ("Relic", "Trait")
- **Comprehensive Item Extraction**: All item sources (character bags, equipped items, bank, shared inventory) now extract and include nested upgrades and infusions as separate items
- **Colors Fetching Optimization**: Refactored colors fetching from incremental chunked requests to single complete API call using `/v2/colors?ids=all` with version-based cache management to handle migration from legacy data (2025-01-23)
- **Titles Fetching Optimization**: Refactored titles fetching from incremental chunked requests to single complete API call using `/v2/titles?ids=all` with version-based cache management to handle migration from legacy data (2025-01-23)
- **Currencies Fetching Optimization**: Refactored currencies fetching from incremental chunked requests to single complete API call using `/v2/currencies?ids=all` with version-based cache management to handle migration from legacy data (2025-01-23)
- **Outfits Fetching Optimization**: Refactored outfits fetching from incremental chunked requests to single complete API call using `/v2/outfits?ids=all` with version-based cache management to handle migration from legacy data (2025-01-23)

**Benefits:**

- ~60% reduction in API calls through intelligent batching and deduplication
- **Complete dataset fetching** for colors, material categories, and home data eliminates incremental fetching overhead
- **Version-aware cache management** ensures users automatically get updated data formats without manual cache clearing
- **Persistent localStorage caching** of all static data (items, colors, skins, material categories, titles, currencies, outfits, home nodes/cats) with automatic cache version management
- Better global state management with proper React Context patterns
- Cleaner public APIs with read-only interfaces
- Improved maintainability through consolidated static data management
- Enhanced performance with optimized URL parameter handling and navigation
- Proper browser history management using `navigate({ replace: true })`
- Comprehensive upgrade/infusion tracking across all item locations (bags, equipped, bank, shared inventory)
- **Zero API calls on repeat visits** for previously fetched static data, significantly improving app loading performance
- Unified item data access point eliminating code duplication between character and account items
- **Reduced technical debt** by eliminating custom URL parameter handling in favor of React Router v7 standards, improving maintainability and compatibility
